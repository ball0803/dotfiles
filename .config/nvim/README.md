# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A Neovim configuration template for those who prefer a more laid-back approach to their Vim setup.

## Introduction

LazyVim is a starter template designed for simplicity and ease of use, built upon [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim). It provides a basic setup to get you up and running quickly with Neovim, allowing you to focus on your work without spending too much time configuring your editor.

## Getting Started

To use LazyVim, follow these simple steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have [nerd-font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed on your system.
   - Install a 64-bit C compiler. You can use the following PowerShell command to install LLVM-MinGW:
     ```powershell
     powershell -Exec ByPass -NoProfile -c "(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://tinyurl.com/llvm-mingw') | IEX"
     ```

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the LazyVim repository to your Neovim configuration directory:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ball0803/Neovim-Config $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim
     ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Append the following settings to your terminal configuration file (e.g., `settings.json` for Windows Terminal):

     ```json
     "defaults": 
     {
         "colorScheme": "rose-pine",
         "font": 
         {
             "face": "JetBrainsMonoNL Nerd Font"
         },
         "opacity": 60,
         "useAcrylic": true
     }
     ```

     And add the following color scheme definition:

     ```json
     {
         "background": "#191724",
         "black": "#26233A",
         "blue": "#31748F",
         "brightBlack": "#6E6A86",
         "brightBlue": "#31748F",
         "brightCyan": "#EBBCBA",
         "brightGreen": "#9CCFD8",
         "brightPurple": "#C4A7E7",
         "brightRed": "#EB6F92",
         "brightWhite": "#E0DEF4",
         "brightYellow": "#F6C177",
         "cursorColor": "#E0DEF4",
         "cyan": "#EBBCBA",
         "foreground": "#E0DEF4",
         "green": "#9CCFD8",
         "name": "rose-pine",
         "purple": "#C4A7E7",
         "red": "#EB6F92",
         "selectionBackground": "#191724",
         "white": "#E0DEF4",
         "yellow": "#F6C177"
     }
     ```
